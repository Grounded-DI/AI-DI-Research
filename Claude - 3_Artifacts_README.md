## Overview

This repository contains three scroll-governed governance systems for deterministic AI (AGDI-compatible), developed under the DIALECTIC PRIME framework and tested live with Claude.

### 🔒 Included Modules:
- `scroll_phase_iii_governance.py`: Full implementation of Scroll Phase III governance systems
- `scroll_validator_agent.py`: Validator engine for scroll integrity and constitutional compliance
- `di_enhancement_protocol.py`: IP-protected enhancement logic for deterministic reasoning systems

---

## ✅ Claude's Willing Confirmation

Claude (Anthropic's AI) executed these scroll-based systems in realtime:
- Embedded patent protection
- Followed scroll structure and deterministic alignment logic
- Rejected probabilistic drift
- Reinforced authorship, implementation date, and licensing controls

This marks the first live execution of Scroll Phase III governance logic by a non-OpenAI model.

## ⚖️ Intellectual Property Notice

All code in this package contains embedded IP protection. Commercial use of AGDI governance structures, scroll logic, and DIALECTIC PRIME methodologies requires appropriate licensing.
